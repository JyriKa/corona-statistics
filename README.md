READ DATA PART CAREFULLY BEFORE USING!

Data:
Data is from Helsingin Sanomat (https://github.com/HS-Datadesk/koronavirus-avoindata)
Read usage restrictions from theis Github page!
As far as I know:
For example you have to cache data if you deploy this app!

Map:
I made map svg from Fallschirmj√§ger work (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Finland_Regions_Map.svg)
Maybe I should make seperate repo for map. When starting this project reponsive map would have been very handy

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
